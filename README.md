# Energy Saving Trust Design System

The Design System code repository contains a library of reusable components, patterns, and examples to support modern design practices at Energy Saving Trust. Additionally, it includes in-house standards, guidelines, and principles for creating inclusive, user-friendly, and effective products and services.

The Design System offers several additional benefits:

- It serves as a centralised design knowledge platform where UX expertise, user research, and best digital practices are codified and accessible to everyone.
- It enables our colleagues to focus on solving more complex digital problems by eliminating the need to spend time on minor visual tweaks.
- By showcasing practical examples, it promotes understanding and consistency with our Brand Guidelines.
- A centralised catalog of Lego-like components significantly reduces design redundancy and overall development costs.

## Community support

The Energy Saving Trust Design System is for everyone. To ensure our efforts remain impactful and relevant to our audiences, we rely on the support of a strong community that brings together the latest research, design methods, and development approaches from across Energy Saving Trust.

If you would like to get involved and help us improve the Design System, please reach out and join our discussions or workshops.

## Design System working group

The Design System working group is a multidisciplinary team of representatives from across the Energy Saving Trust. The group ensures that all components and patterns published in the Design System are of high quality and meet user needs.
