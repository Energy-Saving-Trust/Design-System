The Energy Saving Trust Design System website together with its [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/Energy-Saving-Trust/Design-System) the  contains a library of reusable components, patterns, and examples to support modern design practices at Energy Saving Trust. Additionally, it includes in-house standards, guidelines, and principles for creating inclusive, user-friendly, and effective products and services.

The Design System offers several additional benefits:

- It serves as a centralised design knowledge platform where UX expertise, user research, and best digital practices are codified and accessible to everyone.
- It enables our colleagues to focus on solving more complex digital problems by eliminating the need to spend time on minor visual tweaks.
- By showcasing practical examples, it promotes understanding and consistency with our Brand Guidelines.
- A centralised catalog of Lego-like components significantly reduces design redundancy and overall development costs.
