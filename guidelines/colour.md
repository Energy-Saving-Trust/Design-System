# Colour Guidelines
Colour is an important tool to communicate and reinforce through aesthetics that we are an organisation that is friendly and trustworthy. The following guidelines are based on the [Brand Hub](https://est.interactgo.com/page/10061) and are meant to extend that guidance to digital products.


## How we use colour to enhance usability

1. **We use colour intentionally.** Our default is to use neutral colours for web components and patterns. Occassionally we use our core colours (and their varying shades). This is because UI components and patterns need to work with a wide array of supporting colours, photography, and illustrations we use to communicate. Keeping to a limited palette ensures these designs will be effective in all these varying contexts.

2. **We never use colours in isolation to convey meaning.** As part of our commitment to accessibility, we never create a design that relies solely on colour to communicate essential information. 
This means for graphs, diagrams, and notices, we always include text and iconography to accompany to indicate states like danger, success, or warning.

4. **We use colour consistently** We ensure that we use colour consistently across our products (a user can expect a back button to look and feel a certain way). This does not mean that all products look exactly the same. It does mean that if we have a 'cancel' button, users can expect it to look the same regardless of which product they use.
