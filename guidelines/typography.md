Text is the primary way our users access information and complete tasks. Effective, accessible content relies on a clear font, consistent headings, succinct body text paragraphs, descriptive links, and scannable lists.

Typography brings consistency across experiences and platforms. Good typographic principles establish a clear visual hierarchy and to maximise readability.

#### Typography and accessibility

Energy Saving Trust Design System components meet level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-spacing) for text spacing and AAA for visual presentation.


## Typeface

Our core typeface is Poppins - a geometric sans serif designed by Jonny Pinhorn and Ninad Kale for Indian Type Foundry.

Poppins is an open source typeface available either as an embed or a download via Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts.



## Type scale

The type scale changes based on screen size.

The scale for ‘large screens’ is used when the screen is wider than the tablet breakpoint (640px).

### Principles:


#### Hierarchy
When establishing hierarchy for GitHub products, designers should remember that we stress efficient, clean reading experiences for our users. Refrain from utilizing color as a primary method of emphasis.

#### Readability

- Line height—Utilize line-height tokens for proper alignment.

- Line length—It's considered a good practice to keep lines around 80 characters or less—W3 Page Structure Guidelines. Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for designing layouts.

- Type alignment—Our content is typically left-aligned and ragged right. Be sensible in deviating from this standard, as justifying, centering, and right-aligning text is atypical of GitHub products.

- Font weight—Adjust font weight to add emphasis and differentiate content hierarchy.

- Letter spacing—Please refrain from altering letter-spacing on our products. There may be rare scenarios in which this is acceptable, but generally speaking, this should be avoided altogether.

- Principles
  - Optimize for readability
    Help readers understand communications easily and enhance their experience, regardless of their abilities.
  - Create visual harmony
    Typography should be consistent and cohesive. Use visual hierarchy and space to simplify complex information.
  - Contextualize for different users
    Tailor for different preferences, operating systems and applications, while keeping in mind how people consume and process information.
