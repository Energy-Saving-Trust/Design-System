## Working with agencies and partners

When collaborating with agencies or third-party vendors, you can share the Design System as a set of guidelines and a reference framework to ensure consistency when developing new websites or digital projects.

## Prototyping

When prototyping in Figma, you can use our Design System library, which includes pre-built components, patterns, and page templates to speed up the process.

1. [Request access](mailto:design@est.org.uk) our Figma library.
2. Duplicate the design file or add it to your Figma project.

## Developing

To install the code and start developing with the Design System follow these instructions.

1. Go to our [Github repository](https://github.com/Energy-Saving-Trust/Design-System).
2. Download the latest code package from the `/dist` directory.
