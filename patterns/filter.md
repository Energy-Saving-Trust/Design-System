The Filter pattern lets users restrict which options they are shown to fit their search criteria.

## Desktop example

{% capture code_render %}
  {% include reusable-components/filter.md %}
{% endcapture %}

{% include component-example.html code_render=code_render show_standalone_page="filter" %}
