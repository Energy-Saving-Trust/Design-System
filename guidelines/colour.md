# Colour Guidelines
The guidelines are based on the Brand Guidelines and meant to extend and reflect the guidance there for digital.

## How we use colour 
For digital we focus on the core colours and use neutral colours for foundational components and patterns. The reason being they need to sit alongside more colorful designs, photography, illustrations and other imagery. Keeping to a neutral colour palette helps ensure that they will look good regardless of the context in which they are placed.

## How to use colour to enhance usability
### Never use colours in isolation to convey meaning
As part of our commitment to accessibility, we never create a design that relies solely on colour to communicate essential information. 
This means for graphs, diagrams, and notices, we always include text and iconography to accompany to indicate states like danger, success, or warning.

## Core colours
We use core colours and shades of our core colours to communicate and highlight important information. For each colour you can see acceptable shade variations as well as the accessibility of each shade on light or dark backgrounds.
